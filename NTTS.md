Hi! DiscordTokenProtector (later refered as "DTP") dev here,

TLDR : DTP protects the TOKEN not the account, nor all your pc. And the bypass has been patched a long time ago.

I just wanted to clarify some points. First of all, the main point of DTP is to protect your Discord token. Not your banking details or other sensitive information on your computer. Therefore, with no surprise, it will indeed only protect you from Discord grabbers. Something that does somewhat well from what you've shown.

This software is opensource, so anyone can check the code, and compile their own versions of it. That's literally why I opensourced this project. And even if I were to push something malicious, it would be obvious in the diffs of the release. And there's no auto update, so it's won't infect every computer that downloaded DTP.

About the "bypass", it has been patched for over a year now. I have seen many grabbers (even recent ones) that use this "bypass". Firstly, the bypass only works if you give admin permissions (with UAC) to the grabber - and if you do so, you've got much more stuff to worry about than just your Discord token as you stated. And second of all, even if you give admin perms, all it does is to remove DTP, and the grabber is NOT able to decrypt the token that is securely stored.

The goal for the end user is that they can be protected from one vector of attack that is commonly used by grabbers. Yes, there are other ways (QR code phishing, RATs with full control of the PC, ...), but DTP's point is not to protect your Discord account, only your Discord TOKEN that is stored on your computer.
